Random Notes





Eureka! An MVVM - model, view, view-model. 
- A view-model is the data layer right under the view!
- It can hold persistent data for the view, as well as owning the model
	- The view-model is updated by the model, or by a data-supply layer inbetween
	- The Controller then updates the view according to the view-model


My app's architecture:
---------------------
Accepting Data and populating UI
- ViewController talks to a DataSupplier, and is given a view-model
	- the view-model determines what views to create (kinds of cells)
	- Once created, the view accepts the view-model as input and binds to it
- Even on load, ViewController creates view-model
	- i.e. refresh control view-model
	- then feeds view-model to the view (the actual refresh control)
	- it is responsible for activating view through interfacing with the view-model

User Input, communicating with the DataSupplier
- Touching the view triggers UI and view-model changes
- Do view-model changes automatically trigger data supplier?
	- So on creation, DataSupplier binds view-model to model?
	- When view-model changes, activates 
		- 1) local data model, or
		- 2) DataSupplier data request
	- Does this happen automatically? Yes, it should.

DataSupplier triggering UI
- When the DataSupplier retrieves data, it sets view-model properties
	- On set, can use bindings to trigger properties to show UI changes
