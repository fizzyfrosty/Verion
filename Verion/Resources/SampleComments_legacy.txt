    "CommentContent": "You can see how they force themselves to put \"false\" and \"falsely\" every other sentence in an attempt to compensate for the lack of substance to back their dismissal of rather compelling evidence against the Clintons.\n\n> X isn't true because it's false. According to (unqualified joe), X has been falsely twisted into a falsehood. 'I said X ain't no true and all and every claims against Clinton are only false as Clinton has never had anyone assasinated and #pizzagate is not true. I should know because I'm (an unqualified joe)\" said (another unqualified joe) about the false accusations that have spread among fake-news websites.  The FBI has not immediately commented on the matter, which goes to show how fake it is. NYPD confirmed that they haven't investigated the affair and found it to be entirely false.\n\n> This brings to light how damaging the 1st amendment can be to innocent lives. Is it time to ditch the first amendment?\nThat's what the residents of the Roses' Elders Home, Washington DC seem to think. \"Hillary Clinton should cancel the election that was rigged by the Russian Federation, and throw Donald Trump in jail for treason\" said Mrs Smiths, 98, who lives in fear since the election results were announced. \n\n>\n> (Corrupt Journalist) for the Washington Post",

    "CommentContent": "The author fails to mention this post she made were she specifies that she believes [there is human trafficking occurring](https://archive.is/XV5t0) in the \"Clinton's Caracol Complex\". The author leaves this post out of his article, but includes [a more sedate post](http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png) she made about Clinton. Because the two posts are linked side by side in almost every context I've seen them in, I have to believe he's seen and read the first post in his research and this is a blatant attempt to deceive his readers. Without the first post, it looks like wild conjecture that she was researching a link between human trafficking and Clinton, which is what this article attempts to portray it as.\r\n\r\nAlso the key \"friend\" that this article continuously cites to back up their claim Petersen was not investigating Clinton, is a Denver based dominatrix. Not exactly a solid witness to the the professional pursuits Ms. Petersen might have had in Haiti.\r\n\r\nAnd still the U.S State Department has not made an official claim about her death. To my knowledge this is the first mainstream publication that has covered her death at all, and the only reason for it to exist is to further discredit \"fake news\". Something is strange here.",

She's still on my list but I couldn't find any proof.

No name, no date, no link - anybody can make something like that up :/\n\nSeeing that WaPo jumps on this so fast makes me believe that it was planted. Be careful what you spread as 'confirmed' just because someone tells you so!\n\nEdit: For the record: I would LIKE to believe this to be a real lead, I just can't with what I see right now...",
