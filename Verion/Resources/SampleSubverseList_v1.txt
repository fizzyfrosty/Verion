      "sidebar": "ELI5: Explain Like I'm 5\r\n\r\nDo you demand a simple and concise explanation of complicated and complex topics?  \r\nFret not, dear voater, for ELI5 is here! Ask a complex question, and get a simple answer!\r\n\r\n#General guidelines:  \r\n**Your explanation should be friendly and straightforward, but not condescending.**  \r\n- 1.1. Above all, you're here to answer questions concisely. Don't get needlessly hostile or complicated in your response.  \r\n- 1.2. We aren't literally 5 year olds. Well, most of us aren't. We can handle big words and long sentences. There's no need to dumb down an explanation unless specifically asked to do so by the asker.  \r\n- 1.3. If specified by the asker, responses to particular levels of expertise are encouraged.\r\n\r\n**/v/ELI5 is a place to get simple explanations of complex topics.**  \r\n- 2.1. Yes/no answer questions, and questions pursuing an answer without an explanation of that answer, are not allowed.  \r\n- 2.2: If it doesn't have an explanation, it isn't an *explain* like I'm five question.    \r\n- 2.3. Refrain from posing hypothetical or personal questions. Ideally, every question should have a factually based, reasonable explanation.  \r\nFeel free to send prohibited questions to /v/nostupidquestions, they'll help you out instead!\r\n\r\n**This isn't a debating subverse:**  \r\n- 3.1. Don't ask for personal opinions (and don't ask potentially loaded questions)  \r\n- 3.2. Don't present a biased response  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Top-level comments should be on-topic.**  \r\n- 4.1. Self-explanatory, really.  \r\n- 4.2. Jokes are allowed and appreciated if they're on topic and not a whole top-level comment.\r\n\r\n**Someone came here for an answer, don't send them somewhere else.**  \r\n- 5.1. Your response should not consist wholly of a redirection link within a sentence.  \r\n- 5.2. It is acceptable to link to outside sources for singular words or concepts. This can be done to save you explaining concepts that are non-central (yet still important) to your response.  \r\n- 5.3. Don't copy+paste from outside sources without paraphrasing. Outside sources don't always explain concepts in layman's terms.\r\n\r\n**Don't know? Don't teach.**  \r\n- 6.1. If you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to teach someone else about it.\r\n\r\nYou are allowed to post a question that's been posted before, but to save your own time, search for it before posting anyway.\r\n\r\nTag your post as \"Explained\" once you're satisfied with an answer\r\n\r\nAll moderation decisions are made at the moderation team's discretion. You won't be protected by loopholes if you're using them to a detrimental effect.\r\n\r\nNow featuring CSS, by /u/jvanderb!\r\n\r\n#The Questions Network\r\n\r\n- /v/nostupidquestions: there are no stupid questions.\r\n\r\n- /v/askvoat: community Q&A\r\n\r\n- /v/AMA: individual Q&A\r\n\r\n- /v/seriousdiscussion: self-explanatory\r\n\r\n- /v/isitbullshit: real or fake? truth or lie?\r\n\r\n- /v/modhelp: help for moderators of all shapes and sizes.\r\n\r\n- /v/thedinnertable: lighthearted discussion about things that don't matter\r\n\r\nOwn a questions subverse?

We have taken notice of various incidents involving conflicts of interest and agenda-pushing within media which we feel are damaging to the credibility of the medium and harm the community at large. We believe the current media is complicit in the proliferation of an ideology that squashes individuality, divides along political lines, and is stifling to the freedom of creativity that is the foundation of human expression.*\r\n>\r\n>*KotakuInAction is a community that condemns willful censorship, exclusion, harassment, or abuse. It is a community that organizes to hold the media accountable to the concept of artistic freedom by standing up for the artist, the developer, the writer, the filmmaker, and all who enjoy the freedom to create, explore, and expand. It is a community that allows the exchange of information, supports the ongoing discussion of media ethics, and protects the right of the individual to embrace their personal interests in entertainment and fandom.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>#RULES\r\n>\r\n>1 | **Don't be a dickparade.** Discuss, don't attack.

Static images only please.\r\n\r\n* Please do not submit links using URL shorteners such as tinyurl - these links will be deleted on sight.\r\n\r\n* Please do not post images of family members unless they depict a verifiable historical event or period - if you have an image of a relative participant while in the historical war that is permissible, but an old group photo of relatives without event context is not. \r\n\r\n* Please do not post images taken or created within the last 25 years.  We are allowing \"then and now\" images as a temporary experiment, so if you want to post an image of a street in WW2 then the same street today that would be allowed for example.*\r\n\r\n* Commentary or opinion should be kept to the comments section of your post, not the title, we do not censor any opinions, no matter how out of the \"mainstream\" as long as they are on topic. \r\n\r\n* Please do not crosspost or link to other verses in your title or comment - this is NOT the place to advertise another verse.\r\n\r\n* You WILL be banned if you brigade, or try to undermine this sub in a comment, post, or PM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rules for Comments**\r\n\r\n\r\n* No personal attacks upon others.  Feel free to argue about the topic heatedly, you can attack the image, but stay on the topic, the person behind the account posting is never the topic.  If a user is bothering you contact the MODS and they will see if rules are being broken.\r\n\r\n* No trolling this verse with disingenuous submissions.\r\n\r\n* Be Welcome!  Please contribute, comment, and share your interest in history here.  The subscribers are the heart and soul of the HistoryPorn verse.  \r\n\r\n* Do not hesitate to reach out to the MODS.  MODS are here to serve you !\r\n\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "sidebar": "Welcome to /v/guns!  This is the home of firearms enthusiasts on Voat.  If you're into things that go boom, this is the place for you!\r\n\r\n**RELATED SUBVERSES**\r\n\r\n*  /v/gunpolitics\r\n*  /v/ccw\r\n*  /v/canadaguns\r\n\r\nThe posting rules are below.  Violations of any of these rules will result in post removal.  Repeated, systematic violations by one user will result in a ban if all of the moderators agree that it's needed.  If you see violations of rules 3 or 4 occurring, don't hesitate to mail a screenshot of the activity to the moderation team.\r\n\r\nModerators are held to a higher standard on this subverse and the rules that they must follow are also posted below.  If a moderator is acting against the moderator rules, take a screenshot and message it to the head moderator, @Thjoth.  Repeated violations will result in their removal from the mod team.\r\n\r\n\r\n**SUBSCRIBER RULES:**\r\n\r\n1.  All content MUST be related directly to firearms.  For our purposes, a firearm is defined as a device that uses rapidly expanding gases to launch a projectile.  Size doesn't matter, so this includes everything from your .22 to a naval cannon.\r\n\r\n2.  No memes, image macros, or reaction gifs are allowed.\r\n\r\n3.  Violation of the global [user agreement](https://voat.co/help/useragreement) will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n4.  Repeated personal attacks upon or harassment of a user across different unrelated threads will not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n5.  No spam.  If you want to promote your personal site, blog, or company, then make sure you participate EXTENSIVELY in other posts as part of this community.  The account of the [Tennessee Arms Company on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/tnarmsco) is a good example of commercial members of the industry participating in a community in a way that betters both the community and the company.\r\n\r\n6.   All politics posts must go into the stickied politics megathread, which is refreshed on the 1st of every month.  If something big is happening (eg. the M855 ban), the moderators will create a specific megathread for that event at their discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n**MODERATOR RULES:**\r\n\r\n1.  Moderators will follow all normal rules.\r\n\r\n2.  When removing a post or comment, moderators will copy and paste the rule violation that led to the removal in a reply.\r\n\r\n3.  Moderators will not take any action whatsoever if a rule from the sidebar is not violated.\r\n\r\n4.  Bans must be discussed among moderators.

Anyone can take part as verifying transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out by the Bitcoin network with no central authority or banks.\r\n>\r\n>Bitcoin is a new invention exploring ideas that have never been attempted before, its future cannot be predicted so use at your own risk. Newcomers should explore [/v/BitcoinGuides](https://voat.co/v/bitcoinguides) for more information and resources.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Can I mine bitcoin?\r\n\r\n>While it is possible for anyone to mine bitcoin only those that make a serious investment will be able to turn a profit. If you're interested in mining as a hobby be aware that you will likely operate at a loss.\r\n>\r\n>You can contribute to the Bitcoin network by running a full node which will host the blockchain and propagate transactions. Running a full node that you have full control over will also improve your privacy and security compared to using a light wallet.\r\n>\r\n>* [Node setup guide by Pavol Rusnak](http://gk2.sk/lets-build-a-freedom-node/)\r\n>* [Node setup guide by Jameson Lopp](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Quick links\r\n\r\n| [Bitcoin guides on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/fredstilleronawire/668c0e25b50d6873d43b#file-more-guides-md)|\r\n|----------|\r\n| [Bitcoin links on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/fredstilleronawire/668c0e25b50d6873d43b#file-more-links-md)|\r\n| [Bitcoin subverses on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/fredstilleronawire/668c0e25b50d6873d43b#file-more-subverses-md)|\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Other subverses\r\n\r\n[/v/BitcoinCore](https://voat.co/v/bitcoincore) |[/v/BitcoinGuides](https://voat.co/v/bitcoinguides)\r\n---------|----------\r\n[/v/BitcoinMarkets](https://voat.co/v/bitcoinmarkets) |[/v/BitcoinMining](https://voat.co/v/bitcoinmining)\r\n[/v/BitcoinSerious](https://voat.co/v/bitcoinserious) |[/v/BitcoinTrader](https://voat.co/v/BitcoinTrader)\r\n[/v/CryptoAssets](https://voat.co/v/CryptoAssets) |[/v/CryptoMarkets](https://voat.co/v/cryptomarkets)\r\n[/v/Cryptocurrency](https://voat.co/v/cryptocurrency) |[/v/VoCatalog](https://voat.co/v/vocatalog)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Community guidelines\r\n\r\n>>This subverse is intended for the discussion of Bitcoin topics, and topics which have a direct impact on Bitcoin.\r\n>\r\n>* Abide by [Voat's user agreement](https://voat.co/help/useragreement).\r\n>* Avoid repetition, please check \"[New](https://voat.co/v/bitcoin/new)\".\r\n>* Be excellent to each other.\r\n>* No begging or asking for bitcoin.\r\n>* No faucets or free bitcoin sites.\r\n>* No scams, spam or referral links.\r\n>* No trades, buying or selling.\r\n>* No URL shorteners, use real links.\r\n>* Original source links are preferable.\r\n>* Stay on-topic.\r\n>* Title NSFW content as such.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Credits and sources\r\n\r\n| [Sidebar image by Jason Benjamin](http://perfecthue.com)|\r\n|----------|\r\n| [Sidebar text on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/fredstilleronawire/39da6c8b70faa32f8f95#file-bitcoin-md)|\r\n| [Stylesheet on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/fredstilleronawire/39da6c8b70faa32f8f95#file-bitcoin-css)|\r\n| [Stylesheet based on Minity by Nurdoidz](https://voat.co/user/nurdoidz)|",
