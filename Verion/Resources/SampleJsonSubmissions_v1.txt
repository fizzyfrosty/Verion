Remember that there live more people in the NY metropolitan area than the Netherlands. For that reason, among others, our establishment is much more entrenched. The elite is socially very immobile, as there is only a small linguistic space for them to operate.</p>\n<p>As you may well know, university frats are where the initiations into the occult begin.\r\nWe got a handful of old, established universities supplying their people to virtually every key position in government and a large majority of all business boards. </p>\n<p>There is no free market, as government spending stands at 44.9% of GDP and very extensive regulation form huge barriers to start-ups and entrepreneurship. Many details of public life are controlled and regulated too.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dutch academia is thinking up rational explanation for the allegations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom_Smeets/publication/229218963_Children's_Implanted_False_Memories_and_Additional_Script_Knowledge/links/09e4150085769763f3000000.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom_Smeets/publication/229218963_Children's_Implanted_False_Memories_and_Additional_Script_Knowledge/links/09e4150085769763f3000000.pdf</a></p>\n<p>On top of that, we have our vast and ancient nobility. Did you know that if our dynastic King wouldn't sign a law passed by parliament, we would be in a constitutional crisis? </p>\n<p>By the way, did you know the constitutional head of State in Canada is the same as in Australia? They never had their 1776.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This, American friends, is the reason you are the last hope for the future of liberty worldwide. You are the first and only country in history founded on the principles of human liberty. \r\nNowhere in the world, social and economic mobility were ever higher than in your great land. The dark occult, festering within the elite of your country, might still be weak enough to conquer.</p>",
