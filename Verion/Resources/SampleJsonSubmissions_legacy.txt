But I learned about the Civil War and the Constitution in grade school and I know it grants them the freedom to express their hatred for me.\r\n\r\nI hate Mexicans that come to my country and refuse to learn English while burning my flag and sucking off my income. But if they are granted citizenship, they have libertad de expresión.  So it goes.  Becoming bilingual ain't so bad. Kapeesh?\r\n\r\nI hate SJWs and their false doctrine of equality and multiculturalism. But in this country, you are allowed to worship satan if you so choose. They can't force satanism on me, but their ideology of equality and multiculturalism HAS been forced on me. That's why I hate those liberal, social justice scumbags most of all.  \r\n\r\nBlacks are 13% of the population.  So are Mexicans.  That means about 25% are liberals/SJWs.  Their disgusting words offend me every day.  Their policies are adversely affecting my life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  Even so, I would never call for their speech to be censored or banned.  We, the majority White Americans that love this country, will have to rely on our own freedom of speech to convince enough people to repeal the laws they have foisted, through guilt or empathy and lies, upon this nation. We have a chance, albeit a slim one, with Trump in the white house to make that change back to a stronger nation; to make America great once again. Let's not let this opportunity pass us by. And always fight for the right to free speech for yourself and even your adversaries.  When they go low by trying to censor free speech, we go high and protect it for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nIncoming Rant...\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the last group of assholes: The rock worshipers.\r\n \r\n\r\nI hate moslems because they adhere to an archaic fanaticism that extols the teachings of a madman warlord paedophile that wiped his ass with his left hand on the back of a goat he just fucked. ISLAM should not only be censored, it should be banned from gaining a foothold in any civilized nation as it's stated goal is to overthrow all governments and replace them with it's own rule. This is not a religion.  This is an invading army that needs to be driven from our lands.  *\"The mosques are our barracks, the domes are our helmets, the minarets are our bayonets and the faithful to mohammad are our soldiers.\"* Their own words. They're already killing civilized people everyday in the west.\r\n\r\nThese sand niggers do not qualify to become American citizens.  They have no rights under the Constitution.  They are not protected by our freedom of speech.  They cannot be trusted to abandon their ideology of conquest because the war book they worship instructs them to practice taqiyya against anyone who is not a moslem.  There is no option.  We have to confront them now and expel all of them from our country.  Tear down their mosques, burn that war manual they call the Quran/Koran/Qur'an (even that books name is a deception). We will **HAVE** to do this.  There is no other option. **It is inevitable.**  Better to do it now when they're only about 1% of our population.  They disregard all laws except the laws in that book they worship.  They will have as many wives as they want.  They will marry as many little girls as they can afford and grow their population as rapidly as possible. They will bleed the welfare system dry and when they have built up their army, they will attack en masse. \r\n\r\nThe moslem is a semite, the enemy of all people. They must be crushed. There is a target sitting in Mecca that can remove one of their pillars of faith with its destruction.  It's a soft target. Once that kaaba is destroyed, many of them may realize their book is a lie and reject the teachings of their false prophet.  It's not going to be easy.  But it must be done.",
